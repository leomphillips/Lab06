```

_Write your comments about image 1 below_

#Invalid maths - There is not 1,026 billion chinese speakers.

_Write your comments about image 2 below_

#Confusing chart presentation and no numerical values attached to chart - lack of quantitative information.

_Write your comments about image 3 below_

#Confusing graphical presentation, x-axis label, and country data name labels. No numerical data given - lack of quantitative information.


## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")

_Write your comments about image 4 below_

#Confusing presentation technique, x-axis scale is inconsistent, y-axis label is too long and unclear, data overlaps and is not understandable.

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?

Wide format data has more rows than columns. Long format data has more columns than rows, where variables are at the top of the columns.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

The data set 'staff' is a wide format data set, since there are more columns than rows.

How many observations are there in the data set?

There are 55 observations in this dataset.


## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = '1975':'2011',
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
  )
```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 3 here

staff_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = year, 
              y = percent,
              colour = faculty_type))  +
  geom_point()
```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 4 here

staff_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
               y = percent,
               colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff_long %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here

ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = year,
                       y = percent,
                       colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here

ggplot(staff_long, aes(x = year,
                       y = percent,
                       
                       colour = faculty_type,
                       title = "Percentage of University Faculty Type",
                       subtitle = "In AAUP From 1975 to 2011 ")) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", 
       y = "Percentage of Faculty Type",
       title = "Percentage of University Faculty Type",
       subtitle = "In AAUP From 1975 to 2011 ")


```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1: Calculating proportion of part-time faculty and plotting change over time.

* Idea 2: Grouping all full time staff together and comparing part time to full time changes over time.

* Idea 3: 

* ...
